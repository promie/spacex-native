# Space-X Native
Space-X Native is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo, designed to bring the latest updates and information from SpaceX directly. 
Written in TypeScript and utilising the Expo Router for navigation, this app offers a sleek, user-friendly experience for space enthusiasts. 
With the integration of TanStack Query for state management and MMKV for efficient synchronous data storage, Space-X Native ensures smooth and fast access to the wealth of information provided by the SpaceX API.
